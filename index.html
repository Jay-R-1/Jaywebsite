        <h1>Welcome to this Raft!</h1>

        <p>
            This Paragraph is for the very new people who have never played or just started.
            The first thing is to be aware of the SHARK, he will eat your raft. 
            To prevent this starving shark from eating your raft, you will nead a spear to poke him, and then he will stop.
            If there are important things like the simple water purifier or the simple grill, it will be best to put in the midle of the raft or away from the outer foundation.
            It will be best to do so because the foundations that might break will break anything ontop of that foundation.

            Barles hold all kinds of goodies such as suplyes that can help in anyway, sumtimes you can find rare items.
            Some things you can get are the basic things you find floting in the water, but also potatoes and beats, and others like scrap mettal which is very usefull for crafting.
            The nets will catch things that flote by you. it is smart to build it behind some foundation so it is protected from the shark.
            A common mistake for biginners is that they think more than one mast will make you faster, but that is not true, it will only take up space, but having one will make you faster.
            Islands are full of wonderfull things, if you have an axe, you can cut the trees for wood, leaves, seeds to grow the trees, and either coconuts or mangos.

        <h2>The tips for when you have things under control</h2>

        <p>
            This paragraph is dedicated to people who have some basic understanding but are still strugling.
            A big thing people miss is that walls ans celings can be helpfull for organization. For examople, you can put three chests on a wall which takes one foundation instead of two or three.
            You can put other things such as torches, simple grill, and other things.
            Planting wotermelons and pinaples are much better than growing potatos and beetroots because it gives more food water, and it saves wood, and you can save it for cooking meet.
