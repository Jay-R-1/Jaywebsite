        <p>
            This paragraph is dedicated to people who have some basic understanding but are still strugling.
            A big thing people miss is that walls ans celings can be helpfull for organization. For examople, you can put three chests on a wall which takes one foundation instead of two or three.
            You can put other things such as torches, simple grill, and other things.
            Planting wotermelons and pinaples are much better than growing potatos and beetroots because it gives more food water, and it saves wood, and you can save it for cooking meet.
